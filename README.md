# ancientChinsesIDE
Ancient Chinses IDE including a text editor, compiler, linker, assembler, simulator. C++ and QtCreater are used.

we designed a coding language called Jiu Zhang, which is written in traditional Chinese, and wrote some sample files to solve some classical mathematical problems, such as “Chicken and Rabbit Cage Problem” (鸡兔同笼问题). With that being said, we include the editor, compiler, assembler, linker, and simulator in our final outcome, and integrate these parts into a Jiu Zhang (九章) GUI for display.
